# Malin's CV website
This website is for my own personal use, to display my experience, education and achievements. It is written in both English and Dutch as my workenvironment is in the Netherlands. It's for now a static frontend site.

## Language
The website is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (mainly through Bootstrap5).

## Updates
As my skills progress, I intend to update the website (content wise), as well as create it from the server side, once my skills in Node.js and backend progress.
