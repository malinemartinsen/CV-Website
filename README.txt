# Malin's CV website
This website is for my own personal use, to display my experience, education and achievements. It's for now a static frontend site.

##Language
The website is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (mainly through Bootstrap5).

## Updates
As my skills progress, I intend to update the website (content wise), as well as create it from the server side, once my skills in Node.js and backend progress.
